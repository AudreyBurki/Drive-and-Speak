# Drive-and-Speak

Ever experienced that speaking may become more difficult when driving, cooking or playing the piano? This suggests that speaking is not as automatic as it first seems. In this project, funded by the DFG and part of the [CRC on variability in language](https://www.sfb1287.uni-potsdam.de/en/overview/) we use a driving simulator to better understand the links between planning utterances and other cognitive resources such as attention. 

Collaborators on this project: Pam Fuhrmeister, Marie Hansen, Audrey BÃ¼rki
